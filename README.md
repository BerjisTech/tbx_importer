[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tbx_importer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tbx_importer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/tbx_importer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/tbx_importer) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/diasks2/tbx_importer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

This gem handles the importing and parsing of [.tbx files](http://www.ttt.org/oscarStandards/tbx/tbx_oscar.pdf). [TMX files](http://www.ttt.org/tbx/) are xml files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

**Ruby**  
```
gem install tbx_importer
```

**Ruby on Rails**  
Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:  
```ruby 
gem 'tbx_importer'
```

## Usage

```ruby
# Get the high level stats of a TBX file
# Including the encoding is optional. If not included the gem will attempt to detect the encoding.
file_path = File.expand_path('../tbx_importer/spec/sample_files/sample.tbx')
tbx = TbxImporter::Tbx.new(file_path: file_path)
tbx.stats
# => {:tc_count=>1, :term_count=>3, :language_pairs=>[["en", "fr"], ["en", "es"]]}

# Extract the segments of a TBX file
# Result: [term concepts, terms]
# term concepts = [tu_id, definition]
# terms = [tu_id, language, part_of_speech, term]

tbx.import
# => [[["6234-1457917153-1"], "the earth, together with all of its countries, peoples, and natural features.""], [["6234-1457917153-1", "en", "noun", world"], ["6234-1457917153-1", "fr", "noun", "monde"], ["6234-1457917153-1", "es", "noun", "mundo"]]]
